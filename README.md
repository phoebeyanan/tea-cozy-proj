This image has the original request. 

I managed to make my website close to what are required but still not completely the same. 

In the "Tea of the month" section, there are five pictures. 
The requirement is the max-width is 1000px, but if I set it that way, there will be two pictures in a row and have three rows of pictures. 
I couldn't find a way to minimize the space in between the pictures. 
Also, if someone else is also doing this project, feel free to review my codes. Thank you!
